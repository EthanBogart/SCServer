# SCServer
Node "backend" to [Pebble Score Center](https://github.com/EthanBogart/BaseballScoreCenter) app that pushes pins to timeline and sends notifications on game start and end.

## Development
To contribute, you must have node installed on your computer. The client also requires the [node-schedule](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-schedule), [jsonfile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonfile), [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request), and [pebble-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pebble-api).
The keys are in a separate file, so you will also need to generate your own keys using the pebble dev-portal in order to run tests.
